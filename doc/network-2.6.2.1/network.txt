-- | Low-level networking interface
--   
--   This package provides a low-level networking interface.
--   
--   In network-2.6 the <tt>Network.URI</tt> module was split off into its
--   own package, network-uri-2.6. If you're using the <tt>Network.URI</tt>
--   module you can automatically get it from the right package by adding
--   this to your .cabal file:
--   
--   <pre>
--   flag network-uri
--     description: Get Network.URI from the network-uri package
--     default: True
--   
--   library
--     -- ...
--     if flag(network-uri)
--       build-depends: network-uri &gt;= 2.6, network &gt;= 2.6
--     else
--       build-depends: network-uri &lt; 2.6, network &lt; 2.6
--   </pre>
--   
--   That is, get the module from either network &lt; 2.6 or from
--   network-uri &gt;= 2.6.
@package network

-- | With older versions of the <tt>network</tt> library on Windows

--   </pre>
--   
--   It is fine to nest calls to <a>withSocketsDo</a>, and to perform
--   networking operations after <a>withSocketsDo</a> has returned.
--   
--   In newer versions of the <tt>network</tt> library it is only necessary
--   to call <a>withSocketsDo</a> if you are calling the <a>MkSocket</a>
--   constructor directly. However, for compatibility with older versions

-- | The <a>Network.Socket</a> module is for when you want full control

--   <a>bind</a>.
--   
--   This function is protocol independent. It can return both IPv4 and
--   IPv6 address information.
--   
--   The <a>AddrInfo</a> argument specifies the preferred query behaviour,
--   socket options, or protocol. You can override these conveniently using
--   Haskell's record update syntax on <a>defaultHints</a>, for example as
--   follows:
--   
--   <pre>
--   myHints = defaultHints { addrFlags = [AI_ADDRCONFIG, AI_CANONNAME] }
--   </pre>
--   
--   Values for <a>addrFlags</a> control query behaviour. The supported
--   flags are as follows:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><i><tt>AI_PASSIVE</tt></i> If no <a>HostName</a> value is
--   provided, the network address in each <a>SockAddr</a> will be left as
--   a "wild card", i.e. as either <a>iNADDR_ANY</a> or <a>iN6ADDR_ANY</a>.
--   This is useful for server applications that will accept connections
--   from any client.</li>
--   <li><i><tt>AI_CANONNAME</tt></i> The <a>addrCanonName</a> field of the
--   first returned <a>AddrInfo</a> will contain the "canonical name" of
--   the host.</li>
--   <li><i><tt>AI_NUMERICHOST</tt></i> The <a>HostName</a> argument
--   <i>must</i> be a numeric address in string form, and network name
--   lookups will not be attempted.</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   <i>Note</i>: Although the following flags are required by RFC 3493,
--   they may not have an effect on all platforms, because the underlying
--   network stack may not support them. To see whether a flag from the
--   list below will have any effect, call <a>addrInfoFlagImplemented</a>.
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><i><tt>AI_NUMERICSERV</tt></i> The <a>ServiceName</a> argument
--   <i>must</i> be a port number in string form, and service name lookups
--   will not be attempted.</li>
--   <li><i><tt>AI_ADDRCONFIG</tt></i> The list of returned <a>AddrInfo</a>
--   values will only contain IPv4 addresses if the local system has at
--   least one IPv4 interface configured, and likewise for IPv6.</li>
--   <li><i><tt>AI_V4MAPPED</tt></i> If an IPv6 lookup is performed, and no
--   IPv6 addresses are found, IPv6-mapped IPv4 addresses will be
--   returned.</li>
--   <li><i><tt>AI_ALL</tt></i> If <a>AI_ALL</a> is specified, return all
--   matching IPv6 and IPv4 addresses. Otherwise, this flag has no
--   effect.</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   You must provide a <a>Just</a> value for at least one of the
--   <a>HostName</a> or <a>ServiceName</a> arguments. <a>HostName</a> can
--   be either a numeric network address (dotted quad for IPv4,
--   colon-separated hex for IPv6) or a hostname. In the latter case, its
--   addresses will be looked up unless <a>AI_NUMERICHOST</a> is specified
--   as a hint. If you do not provide a <a>HostName</a> value <i>and</i> do
--   not set <a>AI_PASSIVE</a> as a hint, network addresses in the result
--   will contain the address of the loopback interface.
--   
--   If the query fails, this function throws an IO exception instead of
--   returning an empty list. Otherwise, it returns a non-empty list of
--   <a>AddrInfo</a> values.
--   
--   There are several reasons why a query might result in several values.
--   For example, the queried-for host could be multihomed, or the service
--   might be available via several protocols.
--   
--   Note: the order of arguments is slightly different to that defined for
--   <tt>getaddrinfo</tt> in RFC 2553. The <a>AddrInfo</a> parameter comes
--   first to make partial application easier.
--   
--   Example: <tt> let hints = defaultHints { addrFlags = [AI_ADDRCONFIG,
--   AI_CANONNAME] } addrs &lt;- getAddrInfo (Just hints) (Just
--   "www.haskell.org") (Just "http") let addr = head addrs sock &lt;-
--   socket (addrFamily addr) (addrSocketType addr) (addrProtocol addr)
--   connect sock (addrAddress addr) </tt>

-- | Resolve an address to a host or service name. This function is
--   protocol independent.
--   
--   The list of <a>NameInfoFlag</a> values controls query behaviour. The
--   supported flags are as follows:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><i><tt>NI_NOFQDN</tt></i> If a host is local, return only the
--   hostname part of the FQDN.</li>
--   <li><i><tt>NI_NUMERICHOST</tt></i> The name of the host is not looked
--   up. Instead, a numeric representation of the host's address is
--   returned. For an IPv4 address, this will be a dotted-quad string. For
--   IPv6, it will be colon-separated hexadecimal.</li>
--   <li><i><tt>NI_NUMERICSERV</tt></i> The name of the service is not
--   looked up. Instead, a numeric representation of the service is
--   returned.</li>
--   <li><i><tt>NI_NAMEREQD</tt></i> If the hostname cannot be looked up,
--   an IO error is thrown.</li>
--   <li><i><tt>NI_DGRAM</tt></i> Resolve a datagram-based service name.
--   This is required only for the few protocols that have different port
--   numbers for their datagram-based versions than for their stream-based
--   versions.</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   Hostname and service name lookups can be expensive. You can specify
--   which lookups to perform via the two <a>Bool</a> arguments. If one of
--   these is <a>False</a>, the corresponding value in the returned tuple
--   will be <a>Nothing</a>, and no lookup will be performed.
--   
--   If a host or service's name cannot be looked up, then the numeric form
--   of the address or service will be returned.
--   
--   If the query fails, this function throws an IO exception.
--   
--   Example: <tt> (hostName, _) &lt;- getNameInfo [] True False myAddress
--   </tt>

-- | Create a new socket using the given address family, socket type and

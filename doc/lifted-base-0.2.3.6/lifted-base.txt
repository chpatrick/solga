-- | lifted IO operations from the base library
--   
--   <tt>lifted-base</tt> exports IO operations from the base library
--   lifted to any instance of <a>MonadBase</a> or <a>MonadBaseControl</a>.
--   
--   Note that not all modules from <tt>base</tt> are converted yet. If you
--   need a lifted version of a function from <tt>base</tt>, just ask me to
--   add it or send me a patch.
--   
--   The package includes a copy of the <tt>monad-peel</tt> testsuite
--   written by Anders Kaseorg The tests can be performed using <tt>cabal
--   test</tt>.
